WoodforSheep is a real boardgame which located in Markham. This boardgame store is not only sell board games but also be rent to its membership. The inventory management and rental order tracking are always a nightmare. Now their website doesn`t have a real-time list to demonstrate their current inventory and rental order. The receptionist always needs a long time to check the inventory and record the rental order in excel or even paper. Also, there membership list is just a excel which cannot react with the rental order automatically. With this support application developed, the receptionist can check the availability of that specific game easily to finish  rental order and manage the membership (create, update or cancel).
